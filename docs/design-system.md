# World design system

Every rule that makes Jev's components look like one world. Primitives use
these tokens and never define their own colors, shaders or sizes. Jev chooses
among the options by their descriptions and never writes a color or a number.

## Principles

- **Painterly light.** Soft cel shading in a few bands, shadows tinted and
  never black, and aerial perspective instead of a fog wall.
- **One material family.** Every component uses the same plant shader, which
  applies cel light, wind, shadow and the vitality channels. A primitive picks
  a swatch and writes channels, and never ships GLSL. Water and sky keep their
  own shaders.
- **v1's components and Breath of the Wild are the visual bar.** A new
  primitive starts from the v1 equivalent where one existed.
- **Subtle effects.** Glow, saturation and motion stay below what draws the eye
  on its own.

## Color

Color works at three levels:

1. **The world** sets light, sky, season and wind for everything.
2. **Each region's biome** sets its ground cover, wildflowers, air, drifting
   accents and the palette families native to it. Ground covers drift into
   each other across region edges (see Terrain).
3. **Each component** has one palette family. Components never blend.

There are nine palette families in `packages/primitives/src/palettes.ts`
(spring-meadow, deep-forest, teal-gold, autumn-ember, cherry-blossom,
silver-birch, desert-sage, lantern-dusk, bluebell-wood). Each gives bark, leaf
and bloom swatches; for the ground, a stone, the moss that grows on it, and a
wildflower's stem and eye; and a building's wall, timber, roof, masonry, trim,
window-glass and smoke swatches, so a family's cottages belong with its
plants. Every family declines toward the same dry grey-brown, so failing
code reads the same everywhere. A season shifts only healthy colors, keeps
each family's identity, and pushes each shifted color a fixed distance away
from its decline color. The `tint` channel varies hue within one swatch across
a canopy; it never touches decline.

## Leaves

Canopies are painted masses from afar and leaves up close. Leaf cards build
each clump themselves: an outer shell gives it a leafy outline and an inner,
darker layer gives it depth, over a small dark core that reads only as
shadow in the gaps. Each family has its own leaf: a canopy's leaves are
pointed, oval (cherry) or lobed (maple), chosen as a parameter of
`leaf-clumps@1`. Willow strands are crossed ribbons of small hanging lance
leaves. A fir spray is a frond: a ridge of needles along the limb and
branchlets to either side that reach toward the tip and droop, so a fir reads
as layered, feathery needles rather than flat plates. A primitive only places
cards and names their cut (`CUT` in `@gaia/schema`: cluster, oval, lobed,
strand, needles, blossom or patch); the plant shader cuts each card to its
leaves, with no textures. Every card shades with the crown's
blended normal, so the canopy lights as one volume. As a card shrinks on
screen its leaves merge into its plain outline, so distant canopies never
sparkle, and a card seen edge-on fades out. Cards drop and wither one by one
as vitality falls, so a failing canopy thins before it goes bare. Cards cast
their scalloped outlines as shadows, so sun falls through between them.

Bushes are leafy mounds built the same way: layered leaf cards over clumps
at every stem tip, down to the soil, over a dark core that hides the frame.
They shade as one volume, bright on top and at the rim, dark underneath and
inside, so they sit in the turf. Their blossoms are small cupped five-petaled
flowers in loose trusses, and berries are small. As vitality falls the cards
drop one by one and brown, the core goes, and bare twigs show.

## Scale

World units are meters; a person's eyes are 1.6 m above the ground, and there
is no avatar. Each kind owns a height band, and the size binding moves an
instance within it:

| Kind | Height |
| --- | --- |
| Wildflowers | 0.3 to 1 m, heads just above the grass |
| Rock | 0.5 to 2.2 m; a ledge runs up to 11 m |
| Shrub | up to 2 m |
| Small tree | 3 to 6 m |
| Tall tree | 8 to 16 m |
| Building | 5 to 9 m a storey or two; up to 14 m with three storeys or a turret |
| Tower | 8 to 19 m, taller with more depending on it |
| Landmark | 12 to 30 m; great stones 3 to 8 m, set out 10 to 25 m across |

## Terrain

No mountains. Landforms (rolling hills, valley, terraces, basin, dunes,
meadow) are relief primitives in each region's biome, blended into one baked
heightfield that every consumer samples. A full world is 1.2 km across with
18 to 22 regions; the tests also bake small worlds, 320 m with 3 to 5.

A region never shows its shape. Region cells are domain-warped, so their
borders curve and wander, and neighboring landforms ease into each other
across a band 130 m wide. Ground covers blend by the same weights broken into
seeded patches about 30 m across, so one cover drifts into the next in
islands rather than along a gradient. The overview marks the selected region
with a faint glow that follows its cover and fades at its edge; walking shows
nothing. `regionWeights` and `coverWeights` in `@gaia/terrain` are the
references, and the bake keeps each sample's four largest cover shares for
the shaders, which interpolate them between samples as the lattice does.

The ground near the person is drawn as five nested rings that follow them,
from 1 m quads out to 16 m quads, each reaching twice as far as the one
inside it. Every ring's vertices are lattice samples, a coarser ring's a
subset of the finer one's, and toward its outer edge each ring morphs, by
distance, into exactly the next ring's surface, so rings meet without a
seam and the ground never changes shape perceptibly as the person walks.
Grass only grows on the finest ring, where the ground is the lattice itself.

The bake enforces a relief budget:

| Budget | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Total height range | 24 m |
| Walkable ground | at least 95% under 30° |
| Steepest ground | 40°, only terrace risers and stream banks |
| Tallest steep climb | 3 m |

Water is solved from the ground and cut into it, so it never floats. The
world's edge is a gentle rim.

Past the baked land the wild land goes on forever and stands for nothing.
From the rim's crest it settles over 160 m to the level of the land inside
the rim, into a gentle roll of at most 6 m, which swells between 200 m and a
kilometer out into soft hills of at most 18 m from trough to crest. A person
can walk or tap their way off the land in any direction and keep going, with
no wall anywhere. The rings around the person draw the wild land from the
same function the walk stands on (`groundHeightAt` in `@gaia/terrain`, whose
integer-hash noise has a GLSL twin), so it follows them; a coarse ring of it
surrounds the world for the overview and the water's mirror. The wild grows
its own two covers, tall unkempt green grass and tall dry golden grass,
which drift in from the land's covers in islands past the rim and mingle
blade by blade in broad swathes. Low brush darkens the ground in dabs that
crowd together where the wild runs to scrub, and wild bushes stand in
seeded thickets there, always healthy. Only the thickets within 1.64 km of
an anchor that jumps to the person every 200 m stand, so every bush that
comes or goes is past where land has fully dissolved into the sky.

Water never stops a person, and they never go under. Walking slows as the
water deepens, to 40% of its pace at 1.1 m; deeper, the feet leave the
bottom by 1.5 m and the person swims at 30% of the pace. Eyes stay 1.6 m
above the ground until the water nears them, then ease down as the bottom
falls away until they float 0.3 m above the surface, and rise again the same
way climbing out: the eye height is a smooth function of depth, so it never
jumps. A swimmer bobs gently, 3 cm every 2.8 s, and the wading rings go on.
At night a swimmer holds the lantern just above the water.

Solid things stop a person: tree trunks at the bark of their base, rocks and
bushes by their outlines at the ground (all of a rock; the heart of a bush,
so the walk brushes its outer leaves), and a house's walls. A stone lower
than half a meter is stepped over, and drifts of flowers are walked through.
Each solid is the convex hull of its outline, so a step that would end in one
slides along its edge without catching: pushing straight at a trunk stops,
pushing at an angle slides around it. The body keeps 0.4 m from every edge.
`walkStep`, `stanceAt` and `solidsOf` in `@gaia/terrain` are pure, so tests
check every step.

A person walks by tapping or clicking the ground, the same with a mouse, a
trackpad or a thumb, and drags to look. The walk plans its way around
whatever stands between (straight when nothing does), follows it at 4.2 m/s,
jogs at 1.8 times that while more than 25 m remain, easing back to a walk by
15 m, and ends within 1.5 m of the spot, so a tap that close to where the
person stands stops them. It heads for a point 1.2 m ahead along its way, so
it rounds each corner in a curve. A tap across a pond swims all the way
across. A tap on a rock or a bush walks up to the face that was tapped; when
solids ring the spot, the walk ends at the nearest place it can reach. The
view never turns on its own. A faint ring marks where the walk will end and
fades when it does. `planWalk` and `walkToward` in `@gaia/terrain` plan and
take each step.

Streams run downstream along the flow solved from their bed (`streamFlow`
and `flowAt` in `@gaia/terrain`), faster where the channel narrows or the
waterline falls. Ponds lie still, and now and then a ring spreads across one.
Looking down, water is clear: the bed shows where it is shallow, and the
water's own teal deepens with depth. At a grazing angle it mirrors the sky,
the banks and the trees, softened and broken by the ripples. A soft line of
foam marks the shore. Rings spread from the person's legs while they wade,
and the water settles when they stop. At night the moon lays a sparkling
path, the lantern a warm glint close by, and living water carries faint
drifting specks of light. Low vitality clouds the water and dulls its
sparkle.

Grass keeps its full height at every distance, so it never grows out of the
ground. Each blade has a seeded threshold and disappears whole once the
viewer is farther than that, thinning from 55% of its reach of 60 m; a
quarter of the blades reach only 14 m and a third only 30 m, so grass is
densest close by. Blades thin the same way, whole, on steep risers and over
the sand banks within one to three meters of water, which the ground paints
from the same shore distance. The ground beneath is painted in the cover's
own colors with short dabs in three directions, so where blades thin out the
ground still reads as the same cover and no stroke runs on into a streak.

Each cover sets its blades' form: how far they lean, how round their outline
is (a pointed blade or a round leaf) and how far they arc over. Lush grass is
soft arcing blades with blunt tips; heather is splayed sprigs with purple
tops in bushy tufts; moss and clover are low round leaves. Blades bend as
arcs that keep their length. The wind rolls across the field in broad, soft
gusts that bow the blades and show their paler sheen.

## Sky and distance

The world should seem infinite, so the horizon never shows a line. One sky
function, `skyColor(dir)` in the shared light chunk, colors both the dome and
the air: the dome draws it and adds clouds, the sun, the moon and stars on
top, and `aerial()` hazes every surface toward it along the same view ray.
Near and middle distance take the local air's tint, lit by the sky behind
it; farther, only the sky's own color remains, and land fully dissolves
between 900 m and 1.4 km. Rays that skim the land pass through the most air,
so far ground just below the horizon thickens into the sky over a band, not
at a line. Low mist
rises from the land into the lowest sky and thins upward, veiling even a low
sun's haze, so misty ground meets a dawn sky in a soft band. Dome
clouds thin out toward the horizon rather than stopping, and clouds standing
on the horizon rise out of its haze. `skyColorAt` and `aerialAt` in
`@gaia/realize` are the CPU references the tests check.

## Buildings

A building stands for an entity. Buildings are as flexible as trees: a few
strong axes of `cottage-plan@1` change the whole form, and walls, roofs and
openings compose on whatever it lays out, so one set of primitives makes a
hamlet of very different buildings.

| Axis | Choices |
| --- | --- |
| Massing | a single block; an L (a wing juts out at one end, its gable looking outward); a T (a gabled wing from the middle); a long range (blocks in line, each narrower); a cluster (wings and outbuildings joined all round) |
| Main body | long, snug or gable-fronted; tiny to roomy |
| Storeys | one to three, and whether joined parts keep one eave line or step down a storey each |
| Roof form | gabled, hipped or half-hipped over the body and its wings; a lean-to's one slope; a turret's cone |
| Attachments | a gabled porch over the door, a lean-to shed, a round turret a storey taller |
| Character | how steep the roofs, how high the plinth, how many windows, how settled and crooked |

Each volume is a mass: walls standing on a rectangle (or a turret's
octagon) under a roof of its own. Joined masses overlap where they meet, so
a wall inside another mass is never built and a wing's roof runs into the
main roof in a valley. Every wall rises to the roofline over it, so gables,
hipped ends, a half-hip's cut-back gable and a lean-to's slope meet their
roofs exactly. A hipped range hips only the ends no other mass joins, so a
long range reads as one stepped roof. Windows fall where walls show, in
every storey, clear of the door, the chimney's gable and each other; a big
building keeps those that look toward the walk, at most fourteen. Its walls
keep within 9,800 triangles and its roofs share 4,300 across their slopes:
fine work (studs, plaster cells, plinth stones, ivy, tile courses) coarsens on
a big building and again until it fits, so a building of many masses keeps
its budget by construction.

A building stands on a pad leveled into
the baked ground under it and its yard, blending back into the land over
7 m, and its foundation reaches 1.4 m below, so it never floats and never
shows a gap. Grass is cleared under the house and along the walk to its
door, and its walls stop the walk. A building stays under 32,000 triangles
and draws one mesh per swatch, at most eleven calls.

A feature sets a building apart and says what its entity does, on the side
the chimney leaves free. A mill's waterwheel turns in a stone-lined pit, fed
by a flume on trestles or pushed round by the race, about once every nine
seconds; it slows as vitality falls and stands still below 0.1. An
archive's tower rises from the back corner, rendered between stone quoins,
taller the more of the code depends on it, its narrow windows lamplit at
night under a steep cap or an open lantern room whose lamp burns after dusk.

A failing building falls to ruin, and reads from 40 m. It gives way first
at the front corner away from the door, where a person walking up sees it:

| Vitality | What shows |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Whole and lived in: lit windows, smoke, flowers |
| 0.5 | Tired: plaster falls in patches, the first holes in the roof's eaves, ivy at the corners, the door ajar, a shutter hanging, long grass |
| 0.2 | Failing: the roof rotted through over bare rafters, walls holed and timbers fallen at the weak corner, rubble below, windows broken or boarded, the chimney toppling, the flower boxes down |
| 0.05 | A ruin: most of the covering gone, the chimney lying across the ridge, ivy to the eaves, rank grass and rubble all round, a tower's top and lantern fallen |

Ruin follows each form: every mass's walls and roof rot by the same weak
corner, a lean-to's whole slope caves in about its high edge, a turret's
cone rots through and its finial leans and falls, and a fallen timber is
one storey's post, so a tall house collapses floor by floor.

Ruin obeys gravity. Every piece knows what holds it up and goes no later
than it: plaster before the timbers framing it, a rail before the pickets
it is nailed to, a trough before the trestles under it, a quoin before
the one below. A piece that goes shrinks back onto what holds it (a
timber onto the post it is pegged to, a pane onto its sill, a board onto
the frame it is nailed to), so nothing hangs in the air even partway
through. What falls comes to rest: a toppled post lies with its head on
the ground, a chimney lies along the ridge, a finial lies down its roof,
and a flower box pitches off the wall and is gone. Ivy grows only where
there is wall to hold it, never past its top.

Every one of these is a vitality channel on the pieces the primitives
already build, so nothing is rebuilt and nothing pops. Ivy and the moss on
a ruin keep the family's moss green: nature takes a ruin back, rather than
everything turning grey.

## Signs and cards

Everything that stands for code says so in the world. A building has a
wooden signboard on a post at the end of its walk, facing anyone coming up
it, with its entity's name and what it is painted on; a tree has a small
plaque on a stake at its foot with its file's name. Signs are always there:
a name becomes readable as a person comes near, as a real sign's does, and
the lantern lights it at night. Nothing fades in or appears. A sign follows
the vitality of what it names: its paint fades and flakes, its wood greys
and it leans on its post. All signs draw as one instanced mesh.

Tapping a building, a tree or a sign walks the person up to it (to the end
of a building's walk, or just outside a tree's crown on their side), and
when they arrive a card opens: in the immersive world, a page laid over the
world (at the top right on a wide screen, along the bottom on a phone); in
the Terrain view, in the panel or the sheet. A thing already close is shown
at once. A new tap or a key
cancels the walk and the card stays shut. The view never turns on its
own. The card reads like a page from a field guide: what kind of thing it
is, its name, what it does, where it lives in the code, its size, what it
leans on and what leans on it, what it stands as in the world, and its
vitality in words (thriving, healthy, tired, failing, in ruins) with the
signals behind it, each with its reading.

## Knowing where you are

The lab opens into the world, full screen, at eye height. Nothing sits on
it but the world and one quiet way of knowing where you are: no panels, no
readouts. A small round of paper in the top corner opens a slip that
chooses that way and leads back to the debugging views (Components, Terrain
and Skies). The hour follows the person's clock (`?hour=22` pins it).
Everything a person reads here looks like the world's own things: warm
paper, brown ink, a serif with italic names and small capitals for paths,
and slow, soft motion. After dark the paper (the map, the slip, a card) is
read by the lantern, a little warmer and dimmer. While a card is read, the
words over the land step back.

The immersive world opens on Gaia's own world. Where a person is comes from
one function, `placeAt` in `@gaia/terrain`: the area (a directory) whose land
they stand on, and the file whose patch of ground is underfoot, if any. In a
world laid out from code each directory's area is a circle nested in its
parent's, the deepest one holding the point names it, and land no circle
holds is the repository's own common ground. In the sample world an area's
border runs where its region's landform gives way to the next, so the
islands where ground covers drift across a border never flicker a name, and
a file's patch is the ground around the tree that stands for it. Past the
codebase's land is the wild, which names nothing.

There are three ways, for the reviewer to choose between:

- **Arrival titles.** Entering an area, after a moment there, its name
  rises softly over the land under a fine rule, with its parent directories
  in small capitals above it, holds, and fades, as a region's name does in
  Breath of the Wild. An area left and re-entered within half a minute is
  not announced again. Standing still brings up a quieter line near the
  ground: the file underfoot and the area's path.
- **The field map.** A map button in the lower corner (or M) unfolds a
  hand-drawn map on warm paper, titled with the repository's name: each
  area a watercolor wash, every area under one top-level directory sharing
  a hue, on the pale meadow of the repository's own common ground, inside a
  thin ink border; each file's patch a faint ring washed in its health's
  color;
  hills shaded from the northwest, water washed blue and inked at its edge,
  trails dotted, trees as small dabs browning with their files' vitality,
  buildings and landmarks as drawn marks, wild brush past the land's edge,
  and a vermilion arrow for "you are here". Names stay one size at any zoom
  and the larger area's name wins where two would collide. It pans and
  zooms by drag, pinch or scroll; a phone opens it close around the person,
  a wide screen shows it whole. Its paper is painted in steps of a
  millisecond or two in the page's idle time after a bake, so it never
  holds up a frame.
- **Markers in the world.** Where a trail crosses from one area into the
  next, a fingerpost stands beside it with an arm pointing each way along
  the trail, each painted with the name of the area that way, and across
  the tread a boundary stone is carved with both names, the one to the left
  above a cut line and the one to the right below it. An arm's paint fades,
  its wood greys and it droops on its nail with the vitality of the area it
  names (the mean of its files', its subdirectories' included); the stone's moss recedes and the stone
  bleaches with both areas'. Posts and stones stop a walker, and no grass
  grows through a stone. A compass strip at the top names the area ahead:
  the first one along the way the person faces that is not the one they
  stand in. Markers draw as three instanced meshes and cast no shadow.

## Trails

A trail is a `link`: a dependency between two entities that Jev judges a
person would walk between. Jev fills only the trail's look, through
`trail@1`'s closed fields: its width (a narrow footpath to a broad cart
track), how worn its tread is, whether stones line its edges, how freely
it wanders, and whether it crosses a stream on stepping stones or a small
footbridge. Jev never draws the route. `planTrails` in `@gaia/terrain`
finds it over the baked ground: the cheapest way at a gentle grade, around
steep ground, ponds and deep water, across a stream where it is narrow, and
wandering off the easiest line by a seeded field as far as the winding
allows. A later trail prefers ground an earlier one wore, so trails meet
at junctions instead of running side by side. The same terrain, requests
and seed always give the same trails.

The ground under a tread eases toward the tread's own grade, averaged over
14 m, and blends back into the land over 2.6 m, as a cottage's pad does; a
trail on a hillside benches gently into it, and no sample moves more than
55 cm. Water and its banks are never touched. The tread is worn earth from
the cover's own soil, darker down the trodden middle, with a ragged edge;
just outside it the grass is dulled and trampled shorter. Blades part along
the tread: each stands only past its own seeded edge, so the border is
ragged, and a faint trail keeps more blades on it. Trees keep 1.6 m off a
tread and the understory half a meter. A footbridge's deck and stepping
stones are walkable. Planks go missing and rails sag as vitality falls.

A trail's wear follows the vitality of the two entities it joins, live.
Near each end it takes that end's entity's vitality, and it blends between
the two across the middle. Between thriving entities the tread is worn to
bare earth, as far as its blueprint's wear says; toward a failing entity
the grass grows back across it, its ragged edge closes and its earth fades
into the cover, until a faint trace and its edging stones are all that mark
the way. Where trails meet or share a tread, the more worn one shows, so
no seam appears. A trail's footbridges, stepping stones and edging stones
take its vitality where they stand. `trailWearAt` in `@gaia/terrain` is the
CPU reference: the bake records which trail each ground sample lies on and
how far along it (`trailPlaces`), and the ground and grass shaders read each
trail's ends' vitality from a small texture, so a change in vitality never
rebakes anything.

## Landmarks

A landmark is a great thing a person steers by: a lookout tower, a ring of
standing stones, or a great old tree. It stands for an entity, as a
building does: Jev decides which entities become landmarks (prominent ones
much of the code leans on suit them) and which become buildings, and
chooses the form. No rule fixes how many; its vitality is its entity's own. `findLandmarkSite` puts it
on the most prominent gentle, dry ground of its region, a knoll or a rise
near the region's heart, and levels its footprint into the land. Each
reads as a silhouette through the haze from 300 m and more, and declines
by breaking, not by fading:

- A tower's blocks fall from the top down, each at its own seeded
  threshold but never later than the blocks it rests on, so a failing
  tower is a jagged stump with fallen stone heaped at its foot and no
  block ever hangs over a gap. A falling block sinks down into the wall
  below it as it goes. Its crown goes first, in tiers (the roof and the
  lantern's glass, then the deck, posts, drum and battlements, then the
  walkway), each shrinking back onto what it stands on, never outlasting
  the wall that carries it; its lit windows go out one by one; an open
  lantern room glows at night like a beacon.
- Great stones lose their lintels and a dolmen its capstone first. A stone
  never bends: it leans whole about its toe (the edge of its foot), falls
  until it lies in the grass, or snaps, its top lying broken at its foot;
  a dolmen's capstone tips until its far edge rests on the ground. A
  cairn is courses of stones each bedded on the ones below; its top stones
  tumble first, sliding down the pile as they go.
- A great tree drops its leaves, sags and greys to a bare snag.

Each landmark primitive has a few strong axes that change the whole form,
as a tree's skeleton does, so the same three primitives make very
different landmarks:

- A tower's plan is round, square or eight-sided; it rises straight,
  tapering, or in stages that set back above a string course; a walkway
  on stepped corbels may ring its top or every stage; and it is crowned
  by a cone (a four- or eight-sided spire on a square or eight-sided
  tower), battlements, a lantern room, or a top already broken long ago.
- Great stones stand in a ring, an avenue of two facing rows rising toward
  its head, a dolmen of uprights under one capstone in a kerb of low
  stones, a field of cairns, or a loose group of lone menhirs, some
  already leaning.
- A great tree is a spreading oak, a tall elm, a great willow, an umbrella
  pine or a dark yew, and young, old or ancient: an ancient tree squats
  lower and broader on a buttressed trunk, some great limbs broken to
  stubs and its highest limbs bare above the crown.

What falls (rubble at a tower's foot, a snapped top, a fallen lintel)
grows in at its foot only once it has fallen, and never stops a walk.

Until worlds come from real code, the terrain lab stands a few landmarks,
more for more regions (about 1.4 times the square root of the region count:
seven in a full world of 22 regions), each for one of its sample entities,
on regions spread far apart; when it wants more than there are forms, forms
repeat. Buildings' floors and walks and landmarks' feet clear the
grass through the same mask as the understory, so a world may hold any
number of them.

## Detail at a distance

A person sees everything around them, near things in full and far things
thinned, and nothing ever appears, vanishes or changes shape as they move.
Every piece of a component (a leaf card, a limb, a petal) leaves whole at
its own seeded distance from the eye, smaller pieces first: a piece starts to
thin 720 times its size away, where it covers about a pixel, shrinks to its
center over the last 15% before it leaves, and draws nothing past that. Of
the pieces of one size, the share still there at a distance d past their
start is (start / d)², and each has grown by d / start, so together they
cover what the full detail would: a drift of daisies keeps its white far off
while its petals thin. A drift's petals start to thin about 14 m off; a
tree's finest twigs and blossoms between 30 and 120 m, and most of its leaf
cards near 300 m. A copy switches to a coarser level only where every piece that
level leaves out has already left, so the switch changes no pixel. Shadows
and the mirror show the same pieces as the view, measured from the same eye.

A pass draws only the cells its camera sees. The sun's shadow map covers a
box around the person, so only casters inside that box draw into it: its cost
stays bounded however large the world grows, and nothing outside it could
cast into it.

## Composition budgets

| Budget | Starting value |
| --- | --- |
| Routes per region | at most 3, covering at most 5% of its ground |
| Open ground | at least 40% of a region |
| Landmarks | at most 1 per region |
| Tree spacing | at least one crown width between trunks |

Jev decides which dependencies become routes; when it wants more than the
budget allows, the most probable win. `planTrails` routes trails most wanted
first and keeps each only while every region it crosses stays within both
route budgets, so the world is never dominated by paths. Landmarks stand
about a quarter of the world's width apart.

## Understory

Rocks lie in groups, bushes in thickets, and wildflowers in drifts of one
species. `scatterComponents` in `@gaia/terrain` places them: a seeded number
of groups per hectare of each region, weighted by its landform (rocks crowd
terraces and basins, flowers favor open meadow), with no two footprints
overlapping, nothing on ground steeper than its rule allows, and nothing
within a meter or two of water. A solid thing sits below the lowest ground
under its footprint, so on a slope its uphill side is buried and its
downhill side still touches the soil; a drift lies on the ground's plane, so
its stems stay upright. Rocks are half sunk by construction. Moss caps their
upward faces and recedes, edges first, drying to lichen grey as vitality
falls; the stone bleaches, and a boulder's two halves slump apart along a
fissure, so it cracks. Moss ends along a soft, winding edge that follows its
own depth across the stone, never the stone's facets, and that edge creeps
back toward each patch's heart as vitality falls. No blade of grass grows under a stone or through a bush's heart: a
mask of each one's outline at the ground clears it, so grass grows up
against a rock and never pierces it. Each blueprint draws as one instanced
mesh per part and level of detail, and drifts cast no shadow. Neighbors never look stamped: each
rock blueprint is built from two seeds and each bush from three (a variant
is one more instanced mesh per part), and every copy also varies its own
shape in the shader, seeded by where it stands: a little taller or squatter,
a lean, and a bulge to one side that grows from nothing at the ground, so the
cleared footprint still fits.

## Clouds

Fair-weather puffs, towering cumulus, cirrus streaks and low drifting banks.
Clouds on the horizon stand in columns: each bearing has its own height, so
towering cumulus rise from the haze in separate billowing towers with clear
sky between them, and banks run long, low and flat.
Cirrus suits only some worlds, and Jev chooses where; it is thin and high,
fine streaks nine times longer than wide, faint, and kept to the upper sky. Mackerel dapples were
removed.

## Day and night

A world's hour follows the person's own clock. Jev chooses how each world's
light looks (the sun's path, its warmth, the brush, the moon and the stars)
but never the hour. `daylight@1` lights eight keys: dawn 6:00, morning 8:30,
midday 12:30, afternoon 15:30, golden hour 18:00, dusk 19:30, moonlit 22:00
and deep night 2:00. Between keys, colors mix in OKLab and the sun and moon
turn at a constant rate; a body below the horizon lends no direct light.

Night follows four rules, all in the shared light chunk so plants, ground,
grass and water agree:

- **Moonlight is a floor.** Night ambient and shadow colors are cool blue,
  never black, and hues fade halfway toward a cool grey under the moon, so
  the land reads as blue shapes while warm palettes stay warm. The moon is a dim soft-cel key, and it casts
  the shadows once the sun has set. Its shadows rise from nothing as the sun
  sinks past the point where its light ends, so the switch never shows.
- **The lantern.** The person carries a candle-orange lantern at hand height,
  a little ahead and to the right. Its pool is about 12 m across and fades
  smoothly to nothing, with no edge; colors come back inside it. On pale,
  muted surfaces such as stone it reads as warm amber rather than full
  orange, which over the moon's blue floor would look salmon, and its
  brightest light rolls off. It lights surfaces only, never the air. It fades in through dusk, sways a few
  centimeters with each stride and settles when the person stops. The Flora
  tab carries none, so plants are judged under the moon alone.
- **The night sky** deepens to blue, keeping a trace of the world's own sky
  color. The chosen moon, the chosen stars, and clouds silvered by the moon.
  A river of stars is a band: a milky glow with a brighter core, split by a
  dark lane of dust. Its glow reaches lower than single stars, so a view
  across the land sees it rise from the horizon.
- **Lamplit windows.** Window glass is a dark pane holding a little sky by
  day; from dusk the lamp inside lights it in the glass swatch's warm
  color. As vitality falls the lamps go out one window at a time, and the
  chimney's smoke thins and stops.
- **The world's own glow** (the vitality `glow` channel, fireflies, living
  water) reads by contrast in the dark, a little stronger than by day and
  still below what draws the eye on its own. Wildflowers fade into their
  blades at night, and drifts fold their open faces shut.
